/**
 * The class that runs the entire LifeRPG GUI.
 * 
 * THINGS TO IMPLEMENT/FIX:
 * - What if we allowed the user to put a picture of their face or something that
 * gets loaded and placed within the frame every time it's loaded? That would be pretty
 * sweet.
 * - Skills, Tasks and Quests need to be figured out. I'm thinking only Tasks in
 * progress and quests in progress will be shown, and if the player wanted to get
 * all the tasks and quests they finished, it would be shown in a new frame.
 * - Color each of the different tasks and quests according to their difficulty when
 * they are shown.
 * - Task table needs to have a marking for whether or not it is part of a Quest.
 * - Leveling up should be more exciting. Can you make a song or sound file play when
 * you level up? Like the Skyrim level up music or something. That would also be
 * pretty cool.
 * - Tables need to be fixed in AttributesAndTasksPanel --> rows need to be reset every
 * time, not just added on every time.
 * - Redraw everything function. One that actually goes through all of the player's
 * tasks, skills and quests and rewrites them up.
 * - Task table needs to include a colors for difficulty
 * - QuestManagerFrame needs to be figured out, as well as quests themselves
 * - Quest table needs to be figured out also - adding rows for tasks?
 * - Miniature version that's lightweight, and not intrusive, like an HUD.
 * - lastActionPanel isn't really being used. It either needs to be added, or
 * removed entirely.
